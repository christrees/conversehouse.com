Himbo and I used the link above.  Himbo even updated the web page.  If you all would bug booboo@conversehouse.com and tell him to send me a booboo bunny picture I'll put it on this site.  Himbo and I and elected BooBoo to run the above rooms.

All the above rooms are active 'forever'.  The only issue is each room needs someone@conversehouse.com to enter the room FIRST... then they will neet to let others in as they ask to join via the link.  I elect BooBoo, Scout, Gus and Himbo to test.
